#
# Configuration file for dbuild.  This file is normally stored in ~/.pbuild,
# but can be customized with environment variable "PBUILD" (full path).
#

#
# Default log file location
# With no customization, you get:  "~/"  (expanded to your home directory)
#
# You can customize with lines like the following:
# logdir: ~/pbuild_logs
# logdir_prior: ~/pbuild_logs/prior
#
# If specified, logdir_prior forms a logfile directory that log files are
# moved to prior to pbuild starting up.  This allows you to save one level
# of prior log files from pbuild.
#
# Be certain to create the logfile directory prior to running pbuild

logdir: ~/pbuild_logs
logdir_prior: ~/pbuild_logs/prior

#
# First-time cache settings (overridded by command line cache settings).
#
# What, exactly, does this do, you may ask?
# This is most useful for automated "tf get" operations, although it works
# in any sort of enlistment. Basically, if specified, this setting will set
# the cache setting to the specified value and then create a marker file in
# the build directory so this is never done again.
#
# This allows you to have a default cache setting that is set initially, but
# override it at any time and have your override stick.
#
# With no customization, you get:  ""  (Nothing done here)
#
# You can customize with a line like the following:
# initial-cache: reset debug
initial-cache: reset debug

#
# Default cache settings if unspecified on command line
#
# How is this different from initial-cache, you may ask?
# If "cache" is set, then we'll do a "make cache" on every single build.
# The "initial-cache" setting will only do a "make cache" once in a sandbox.
#
# With no customization, you get:  ""  (cache settings unchanged)
#
# You can customize with a line like the following:
# cache: debug

#
# Default branch to build if unspecified on command line.
# With no customization, you get:  ""  (no branch).
#
# If no default branch is defined, and no branch is specified on the command
# line, then no host entries may contain branch specifications (for backwards
# compatibility, or to insist that a branch is specified).
#
# NOTE: This line must appear before all host entries to be handled properly!
#
# You can customize with a line like the following:
# branch: main

branch: vmm-main

#
# Systems to exclude in the build:
# With no customization, you get:  ""
#
# You can customize with a line like the following:
# exclude: sun_5.10_sparc,suse_9_32

#
# Settings that may be customized:
# With no cusomization, you get:
#   "DeleteLogfiles,NoDiagnoseErrors,NoLogfileBranch,NoLogfileRename,Progress,SummaryScreen,TFProxStart"
#
# You can customize with a line like the following:
#
# settings: LogfileRename

settings: LogfileRename,SummaryScreen,TFProxStart,DiagnoseErrors,NoDeleteLogFiles

#
# Test settings that may be customized:
# Attributes are controlled with "test_attributes",
# Test names are controlled with "test_names".
#
# With no customization, you get all tests (no restrictions)
#
# You can customize with a line like the following:
#
# test_attributes: -slow
# test_names: atomic,condition

#
# This rest of the file contains lines with three pieces of information per
# line (space separated):
#   Optional: "Host:" constant to specify that this is a host entry
#   Key (name for referring to the entry)
#   Host name (DNS name or IP address)
#   Directory path on host
#   Optional: Branch specification (to match with command line and/or default)
#   Optional: Project (must specify branch to specify project)
#      Project must be one of:
#         om (for Operations Manager)
#         cm (for Configuration Manager), or
#         nw (for NanoWEBM)
#      If not specified, will default to om
